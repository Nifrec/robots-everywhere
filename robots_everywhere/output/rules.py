class RuleExpression:
    """
    Class for encapsulating an rule expression, according to rules below,
    and pretending it is a normal function:

    In general, the rule-defining syntax is:

    rule [expression 1] [comparison] [expression_2] | [expression_3]

    Where:

    (1) [expression 1], [expression 2] and [expression 3] are 
        any valid expression, described further below.
    (2) [comparison] is one of ==, >=, <=, > or <, 
        and indicates whether [expression 1] must be equal, 
        equal or greater, equal or smaller, greater or smaller 
        than [expression 2], respectively, for the rule to be satisfied. 

    Expressions contain either Variables, constant numbers or both, and evaluate to a single number. Variables must always be indexed, as they generally speaking have multiple entries. Given a Variable named x, it can be indexed as x([specifier] [num]), where

    [specifier] is one of any, allButLast, last, first, allButFirst
    [num] is an integer. 

    Supported binary operations are +, -, /, * and % 
    (which correspond to the usual arithmetic operations, and % to modulus). 
    The unary operation mean(x(...)) is also supported, 
    with returns the sample mean of a subsequence x(...).
